## Hi, I'm Savina! 👋  
I'm a Master's student in **Physics of Data** at the University of Padua, working at the intersection of **astrophysics**, **data analysis**, and **scientific computing**.

This profile contains the **projects I developed during my studies** — most repositories include **both the main project and the related assignments/homeworks** inside them.

## 🔭 Projects

### Cosmic Ray Track Reconstruction  
Reconstruction pipeline for muon tracks using drift-chamber detectors (INFN Legnaro).  
The repository also includes the **course assignments and analyses** that build up to the final project.

### Exoplanet Transit Detection  
Synthetic BATMAN light curves + ML classifiers (SVMs, NNs) on Kepler data.  
All **weekly tasks and intermediate steps** are inside the same repository.

### TauREx Atmospheric Retrieval  
Full workflow for the A/B/D retrieval tasks.  
Assignments, tests, and notes are **integrated directly in the project folder**.

### Laser Guide Star (LGS) Simulation Tools  
IDL + Python utilities for sodium-layer sampling and coordinate export.  
Includes the **course work** leading to the final simulation tool.

### CubeSat CCR Subsystem  
Code and analysis for the ESA test campaign, with relevant **preparatory tasks and documentation** included in the repo.

### Spark Benchmarking  
Parameter sweeps for distributed performance analysis.  
The **assignments for the course** are stored inside the project folder.
